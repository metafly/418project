# CacheM_ALL: Cache Memory Access Load Latency Simulator

Fall 2019: 15-418 Term Project

The goal of this project is to comprehensively test different loads on different kinds of processor layouts(SMP, NUMA, hybrid) and conclude what kind of layour benefits what scenario. 

## Current Status of Repository

 * Clone the 418CacheSim repo by @kshitizdange and understand how it works and run.

## Future Goals

* Implement NUMA processor architecture
* Implement hybrid architecture
* Get traces 
* Start testing and writing reports
